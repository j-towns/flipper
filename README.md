# Flipper
Flipper is a small _reversible_ language, implemented
and embedded in Agda. Flipper aims to make it syntactically clear what the
result of reversal, or 'flipping', will be, and supports many native Agda features including
dependent types. For a brief introduction to Flipper and its capabilities, see
the [Guided Tour](Tour.lagda.md).

## Dependencies
Flipper depends on Agda itself and Ulf Norell's
[agda-prelude](https://github.com/UlfNorell/agda-prelude).
