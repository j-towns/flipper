# Flipper
Flipper is a small _reversible_ language, implemented
and embedded in Agda. Flipper aims to make it syntactically clear what the
result of reversal, or 'flipping', will be, and supports many native Agda features including
dependent types. For a brief introduction see
[this paper](https://j-towns.github.io/papers/flipper-short.pdf). The
literate Agda source code for the paper is in this repo, filename
[short-paper.lagda](short-paper.lagda).

## Dependencies
Flipper is tested with Agda 2.6.3, and depends on Ulf Norell's
[agda-prelude](https://github.com/UlfNorell/agda-prelude).
